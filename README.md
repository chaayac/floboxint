# Flobox Task
A test web-app for Flobox.

<p><strong>Setting up the database</strong></p>
<p>To get the postgres database up and running, open your terminal and navigate to the project root directory and type the following (make sure postgres is running!).</p>
<p><code>sh db_init_script.sh</code></p>

<p><strong>Starting the server</strong></p>
<p>Once this is done, run the server however you like (I've used the built-in php server for my testing). You can do so like this:</p>
<p><code>php -S localhost:$PORT_NUMBER</code></p>
<p>Where $PORT_NUMBER is an open port on your PC (I used 8000)</p>

<p><strong>Start using it!</strong></p>
<p>Open up your browser to http://localhost:$PORT_NUMBER/login.php and away you go!</p>

<p><strong>Some notes</strong></p>
<p>As mentioned to Steve, my knowledge with php is quite new (just started learning it for the purpose of this project). I'm very open to suggestions on how I can improve the style and approach I use in this web-app. Contact me if there's any issues!</p>
